title: "Setting up a new analytic project"
---

All standalone analytic projects being conducted in our TSD area should have their own folder created within `data/durable/projects`. Please do not use personal folders for files related to analytic projects. If you do need to use a personal folder, please create one in `data/durable/people`, rather than using the limited space on the `C:/` drive, which can cause us major problems.

We have created a new project template as a start point for all users, which you can use to initialize a project folder for your project. It provides a standardized structure for storing the files from your analyses. Keeping to this structure helps to make it easy for collaborators (and, if required at a later date, administrators) to navigate your project. The template is wrapped up as an Rstudio project file, making it especially easy to work with in RStudio. However, **you can use this project template whether or not you intend to use R for your analyses** – the file structure, version control (via git) and links will still be useful to you.

Here are three options for using the template to initialize your project:

## ***Option 1: via {phenotools} (recommended)***

The [phenotools](https://github.com/psychgen/phenotools) package (see full details the [Using MoBa phenotype data](https://osf.io/necbg/wiki/Using%20MoBa%20phenotype%20data/) section of this wiki) has an `initialise_project()` function for this purpose (you will have to set up version control manually if you want to use it, if using this method – instructions in the [Happygit guide](https://happygitwithr.com/)).

## ***Option 2: via Gitea (currently only available on win-01 and win-02)***

If you have not yet set up your Gitea account within TSD, do this now by following the instructions [here](https://osf.io/necbg/wiki/Gitea%20-%20version%20control%20and%20collaboration%20within%20TSD/).

By ‘forking’ from the repository containing the project template, you can create your new project starting in Gitea and then work with it. Here is how to do it:

1.  Login to gitea via a browser (recommend Firefox), and click on the ‘Explore’ tab, and search for ”new_project_template”

2.  Click “new_project_template” link to enter the repository for the template, and then click the “Fork” button on the top right of the screen. Fill in details for your project in the resulting dialog:

3.  You have now initialized a new repository, of which you are the owner, based on the files and directories of the template. The final step is to link the repository to your local windows vm. To do this, click the ‘copy’ link next to the repository address:

4.  Open the program Git GUI on your Windows vm on TSD and select ‘Clone existing repository’. Paste the link copied in step 3, and add the filepath for where your project folder should go (ideally data/durable/projects/\>type_project_name_here\<):

5.  Once the repo is cloned, you can now access the files and folders via Windows explorer. You can open the Rstudio project as a whole by navigating to the project directory and double-clicking on the .Rproj file (you may want to change its name from new_project_template.Rproj to something relevant, but it doesn’t matter). It is also possible to clone a repo in Rstudio directly using ‘File..New project…Version Control’ (replacing step #4 above) if you have already synced up git and Rstudio as described in the previous section

See the Gitea section of this wiki for a brief overview of Git/Gitea workflow for your new project, and for how to add Gitea collaborators.

## ***Option 3: via Windows Explorer***

It is possible to copy the new_project_template files directly to a project directory you create in Windows explorer (from data/durable/common/new_project_template). You will have to set up version control manually if using this method – instructions in the [Happygit guide](https://happygitwithr.com/).
