title: "Enable version control (Git) in RStudio"
---

After initializing a project with either ***{phenotools}*** or manually via Windows Explorer, we encourage you to use git to version control your analyses in TSD. In order to set up version control in RStudio, you can follow the workflow:

1.  Verify that Git is correctly identified in RStudio:

    Open RStudio

    Click *Tools* -\> *Global Options* -\> *Git/SVN*

    Git executable should show "C:/Program Files/Git/bin/git.exe", otherwise you can click *Browse* and select the git executable installed on the virtual machine.

2.  Enable Git in the existing R Project

    Open the existing R Project

    Click *Tools* -\> *Version Control* -\> *Project Setup*

    In the drop down menu *Version Control* *System* select *Git*

    You will be prompted to restart your RStudio session to enable Git

After following theses steps, you should have a new tab labeled *Git* next to the tabs Environment, History, Connections. You can use this tab to make commits and view your commit history. To make your first commit:

-   In the Git tab, stage the desired files to be committed (tick the box next to the file name). Click *Commit* and write a commit message (explain the reason behind your changes).

You can also view your full commit history clicking on *History*. It is possible to filter by file, directory and branch, so only relevant commits are shown.

Alternatively, it is possible to use the Terminal within RStudio to execute Git [commands](https://git-scm.com/docs). Next to the Console, there is tab Terminal that can be used to execute git commands (make sure that *Tools* -\>*Terminal Option*s -\> *New Terminals Open with* -\> *Git Bash* ). Otherwise, you can click on More (in the Git tab) and select Shell/Terminal from the drop-down menu.
