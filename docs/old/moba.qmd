MoBa is a prospective population-based pregnancy cohort study conducted by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. All pregnant women in Norway were invited to take part in MoBa via postal invitation distributed after their routine ultrasound examination at 17-18 weekâ€™s gestation. MoBa has a trio (mother, father and child) design including phenotypic (i.e., questionnaire and linked data) and genomic (i.e., single nucleotide polymorphism; SNP) data. The full cohort now includes 285 000 participants, with DNA data available for 239 000 participants (59,000 complete trios). Full cohort descriptions are available in the MoBa Cohort Profile publications (Magnus et al., 2016, 2006).
