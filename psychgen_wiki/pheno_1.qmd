![](img/phenotools.jpg){fig-align="center"}

The PaGe/PsychGen group has been developing an R package called [**phenotools**](https://github.com/psychgen/phenotools) that can be used to work with phenotype data from MoBa and linked registries (such as the Norwegian Patient Registry). It is still in development, and so comes with a warning (variables are still being quality controlled and up until v1 of the package you may need to re-run analyses if coding errors are discovered), but is currently our recommended way to curating datasets for your analyses.

On Windows you can install as follows (first check the common/software folder to see what the latest version is, replacing *x/y/z* below accordingly):

``` r
   install.packages("//tsd-evs/p471/data/durable/common/software/phenotools_x.y.z.zip", 
                     repos=NULL,
                     type = "binary")
```

...and then run `vignette('phenotools')` for examples and instructions. External to TSD, the code for `{phenotools}` will be periodically updated on [**Github**](https://github.com/psychgen/phenotools)**.**

Refer to the results of `available_variables(source="moba")` or to `phenotools::moba` / `phenotools::moba_varnames`, or directly to the MoBa annotated questionnaires and instrument synthesis documentation for what you can pull from the questionnaires data files.

Datasets curated using `{phenotools}` will automatically exclude withdrawn participants as described above.
