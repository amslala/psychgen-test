An overview of available software on TSD is [here](https://www.uio.no/english/services/it/research/sensitive-data/use-tsd/software/).

The standard software for analysis in MoBa are **R and Stata**. If a program you require is not listed in the available applications, it is worth contacting your MoBa collaborator to see whether it can be installed.

For those of you more familiar with SPSS, SPSS data files are available and can be opened through R without needing SPSS (recommend using the `read_spss()` function from the `{haven}` package). SPSS only works for University of Oslo employees who get it for free, others need a license to use it in TSD. The MoBa phenotype data folder also contains Stata files.
